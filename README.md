Creating a new repository

Born and raised by a loving rural community in Moletjie Mabokelele, where every adult is your mother and father. 
Very passionate student of life and success. 
I am always improving myself in various fields and ways. 
I do not believe in fear because it blocks and restricts one to their comfort zones whilst their ultimate passions and life journey only start beyond the point of fear. 
I am a natural born leader but develop the skill by learning and serving as well. 
Talented and very caring.
